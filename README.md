# FASTA Scan

This program allows the user to extract sequences from the output of the FASTA program (https://fasta.bioch.virginia.edu/fasta_www2/fasta_down.shtml).

Sequences can be extracted after manual choice or by using various parameters like homology percent, homology length etc

The sequences can be exported in FASTA format or in query-anchored format.


The FASTA program must be used with the '-m 10' option for the output format (see https://fasta.bioch.virginia.edu/wrp_fasta/fasta_guide.pdf for details)
