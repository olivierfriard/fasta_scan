# fasta_scan

This program allows the user to extract sequences from the output of the FASTA program (https://fasta.bioch.virginia.edu/fasta_www2/fasta_down.shtml).

Sequences can be extracted after manual choice or by using various parameters like homology percent, homology length etc

The sequences can be exported in FASTA format or in query-anchored format.
